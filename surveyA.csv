"2020/11/28 6:14:06 PM GMT+1","Yes","Yes!","A17","Female","22","Human Fall Flat, Payday 2, Minecraft","Seeker - curious about the game world and enjoys moments of wonder.","Yes!","The arrow got confused middway through the game, had to find the honey without using the provided navigation.","Had a strong sense that the games biggest inspiration comes from the game Shelter 2, with the visual design as well as the game idea itself- providing food for the cubs. However, the massive difference between that game and this alpha is that there is lack of sense of wonder- it is more of a puzzle/labyrinth game that had the potential to show an interesting world building, yet it felt as being cut from it. As well as it would be preferable to play the bear in third person, similar to the Shelter 2, as the game would give the audience a better perspective.
Despite seeing a few interesting spots (the camp, the cave) the whole terrain still felt flat or not fully developed. There are good assets within the game itself, it just hasn't been used to its fullest potential. The terrain could use more variation and the world could definitely be more refined and worked on (Good example of that would be Subnautica, Mount and Blade: Warband). It be interesting to experiment with the colour changes of the different areas to give a better contrast as it would really improve the world building itself.
I did enjoy the surprise of having to run away from the bees, however, it was very easy to dodge them when making the wrong turn. Perhaps it would be nice to make the bees move slightly independently (not follow your track), so it wouldn't be easy to escape them. Also instead of the bees spawning the moment you collect the honey, it would be interesting to see them already flying around the tree, so the audience would be foreshadowed of an upcoming chase scene.
I highly suggest reworking on the sound design- the sounds of the footsteps felt off, should definitely do more work in that sphere. As well as it would be preferable to not have the music on loop. Best suggestion for that would be to have the song come up with a different twist as the character enters a different area. For example, when entering the cave, have the song be played on a lower volume with a bit of an echo as well as occasional sound of a xylophone playing along the tune.

Games I highly suggest researching on and taking examples from for the further development of the game would be: Shelter 2, Subnautica, Brothers- A Tale of Two Sons, Ori and the Blind Forest."

I liked that the bear received ""damage"" upon standing above fire. The part with the vines blocking the path was also quite nice, especially considering that the player might enter that area while running away from the bees.

Some issues I found:
• In intro video sound is panned completely to left side
• Bees sometimes get stuck
• Player controller is a bit ""sticky"" (sticks to walls and ceiling)"

The bees should have been in my opinion a bit faster, so when i did accidentally run down the wrong way, i would be caught, instead of being able to run around to freedom.
Final notes, the game was pretty cute."
