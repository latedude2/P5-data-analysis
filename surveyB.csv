When the Narrator speaks, the music should be turned down by around 65%
Liked the direction of the art style, though I would prefer more detail.
The skybox felt sort of too empty, unnatural. It needs more clouds maybe. It's clear that something is missing.
The controls should feel a lot more smooth.
Going through the traps/obstacles feels clunky and slightly annoying instead of fun because of the controls. Especially annoying was going through the field of beans or whatever those green plants are. A challenge is okay, but there were about a third maybe a fourth too many.
The chase felt too long/meaningless because of the lack of traps and or obstacles. There weren't enough things happening to warrant such a long chase.
Also, the bee shouldn't wait for you, it should keep going and you'd have to catch it.
Note that when you do this, you should include an option to pause the game. 
The whole chase should be more like an actual obstacle course.
When you hold down e to complete an action, change the timer to be 1-1.5sec faster.
Also, change the color of the inner bar (when holding down e) cause it's not very visible.
One last thing: Tell the player at the very beginning that he will have to find their way back so they should remember the course.
General thoughts: The game has replayability potential, though it needs more work."

","It's weird that you can jump on plants as a full grown-ass bear and jump from one another. Also, I would recommend to let bees sting you only 3 times, as there are 3 of them and when bees sting they inevitably die. Still, a lovely game with a funky soundtrack and extremely cutely drawn cutscene. Thank you for including captions."

You had to be feeding them growth hormone, creatine and bathing them in Chernobyl river water for them to be that big. Plus, I got lost a bunch of times and had to run around in circles since I had no map. But then again, it's partially because I'm mentally disabled. The game's mechanics could use some improvements, because the movement wasn't as fluid as it could be, which was especially apparent when I had to jump on those boulders to make it through the tunnel. Other than that, the game could use a bit of a more developed backstory  and a more refined scenario, since I've found it to be somewhat simplistic. For example, the bear was a schizophrenic and he had no family and was having a psychotic episode and in the end he jumped into the lake and woke up in the psychiatric ward as an 80 year old woman from Alabama. Also, I wish I had a gun and could murder those bees for having the sheer audacity to try to kill me with their katana stingers just for borrowing a little bit of honey to feed my starving family. And the last point - I tried jumping into the lake in the end to conclude my pointless existence and end my pathological suffering, but was teleported back from the lake every time. A metaphor for the way god treats me in real life, it seems. Other than that, you can obviously create great game with your skills. Also, the music is a clear 10/10 - had me on my toes while I was running away from those obese insects."
